There are some public DICOM SR samples that are ***NOT COMPLIANT*** with the Imaging Analysis Result Content definition in Vol 3 Sec 6.5 of the 
IHE AI Results (AIR) Profile (https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/Radiology/IHE_RAD_Suppl_AIR.pdf); 
however, the sa,ples may help as a reference for use of DICOM TID1500, which is one part of the content definition in AIR.

This is part of Khalid Younis' (Philips Healthcare) work with DICOM WG20/HL& Imaging Integration WG in the project for mapping of DICOM SR To FHIR
