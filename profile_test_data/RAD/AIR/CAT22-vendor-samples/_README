The subdirectories contain AI Result samples shared by participants in the IHE Connectathon in September 2022 
who tested the Evidence Creator actor in the IHE RAD AI Results (AIR) Trial Implementation profile 
(https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/Radiology/IHE_RAD_Suppl_AIR.pdf).

These DICOM samples may be compliant with the constraints specified in Volume 3 of AIR, but are not guaranteed 
to be so.

To download a sample .dcm from one of the sub-directories in this repository:
(note, these steps apply to using Github in a browser)
-- navigate into the sub-directory containing the .dcm file of interest
-- select the file name
-- once the file is selected, find and click the 'Download' button on the right side of the github UI
