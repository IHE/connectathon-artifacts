This folder contains HL7 IPS example files from different sources. Files are not guaranteed to be correct. Please use them to extract the clinical data needed for your testing. Explanations / expectations are documented for IHE Connectathon testing of the IPS, QEDm and mXDE profiles can be found:
- IPS TBD
- QEDm TBD
- mXDE TBD

The table below describes subfolders and origin of the files in the folders. Notes:
- The ips-dstu3 folder contains files based on FHIR DSTU3 and not FHIR R4.
- The file names contain a string with the pattern "eumf-xx-yy". The string is the one created by the Trillium Bridge project to identify the patient. We maintained that naming convention with the hand constructed files.
